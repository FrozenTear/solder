# Solder TODO

## Future Plans

- [ ] **Integrate into sootmix** - Extract graph canvas into `crates/sootmix-graph/`, make it an optional feature in sootmix. Solder becomes a thin standalone wrapper.

## Current Features
- [x] Visual node graph for PipeWire
- [x] Auto-layout (L key) - sources left, sinks right
- [x] Drag to connect/disconnect ports
- [x] Pan and zoom
- [x] Friendly node names (node.description)
- [x] Isolated nodes separated from main graph
- [x] Reduced curve bending for aligned nodes

## Ideas
- [ ] Node grouping/coloring by type
- [ ] Search/filter nodes
- [ ] Save/load layouts
- [ ] Undo/redo for connections
